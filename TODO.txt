=========== ISSUES ============

26/8	@Mad Martian			Mad Martian: I am playing with the latest and having an issue - it stopped farming pokestops and catching pokemon. 
								Pokestop farm count this session is only 82 and pokemon catch count 80  and XP farmed about 35k, so it did not hit
								the max on any of those. Items are 313/350, so I am not maxed out on items either. It has passed by 17 pokestops
								without farming so far. It stopped farming back when "The current Pokestop is in the cooldown period" and then never
								started farming again. It also has not caught any pokemon since that same warning. It has been walking around and
								doing nothing but noting pokestops (without farming) for 50 minutes. I stopped the bot and checked manually and the
								account is fine. No warnings, I can farm and catch, and there are advanced pokemon.

								[8:52 AM] Mad Martian: Other things I see in the log - could have something to do with breaks or lures. I am not using advanced breaking - just one minute every 18 minutes. I have break for lures enabled, but not use lures at breaks, yet I see this in the log at the start of the problem: "Reached break location. Using Lures Enabled"
								[8:56 AM] Mad Martian: Here's a log sample from the last caught pokemon:
								[21:58:15] Caught Eevee CP 273 IV 68.89% got 210 XP | 3 Candies | 100 Stardust

								[22:21:38] Next Pokestop: Eagle Flag Pole in 39.23m distance.

								[22:28:48] Next Pokestop: Marble Doorway in 98.74m distance.
								[9:02 AM] Mad Martian: The "pokestop is out of range" error is a bit weird since it isn't even trying to farm. Only happened once.
